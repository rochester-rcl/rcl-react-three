# rcl-react-redux-boilerplate
Finally! A template for all of our React projects. This template currently integrates the following into the React stack:

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - for state management

[Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) - for handling side-effects in Redux

[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) - for static type-checking

[Semantic-UI-React](http://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) - for UI components

[React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - for routing


## Usage
Clone the repository with the project name of your choice:

`git clone https://github.com/rochester-rcl/rcl-react-redux-boilerplate.git my-project-name`

cd into the project directory and run `npm install`

Since this is just a slight variation on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) template all of
those npm scripts are available here, including:

```
npm start
npm run build
npm test
npm run eject
```

Simply run `npm start` and head to localhost:3000

Any additional packages can be installed in the usual manner, eg:

` npm install --save d3 `
